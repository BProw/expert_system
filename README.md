**Assignment from CS 3210 - Spring 2020 - MSU Denver - Dr. Thyago Mota**  

## Description  

The Expert System (ES) will try to guess the NBA player the user chooses from three teams (limited list). The ES makes guesses based upon questions it asks the user to determine the player.  

## Assignment Instructions:  

"Your goal in this programming assignment is to build an Expert System (ES) in Prolog.  It is up to you to decide how you are going to structure your ES. Your ES must be able to “learn” from the user using dynamic clauses (both positive and negative ones).  Your ES should also have a minimal number of 15 distinct classes."
